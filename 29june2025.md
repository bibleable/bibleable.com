ABLE is a bible paraphrasing for everyone including special needs people.

The principle for this paraphrasing 
1. use plain paraphrase
2. everyday vocabulary
3. shorter phrases. 
E.g. In the beginning. -> Everything began with God. He made the heavens and the earth. 
4. Remove all abstraction. Use simple words and concrete images
5. The final goal is to see whether the special needs person knows Jesus. 
6. Lower vocabulary than 1200 words. 



The priority. We will pick one over the other in times of conflict. 
- understanding
- length of phrases
- sentence structure.
